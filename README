Germinal is a minimalist vte-based terminal emulator.
It won't evolve much since it's just a small project inspired by Sakura to fit my needs

You need glib 2.28, gtk+ 3, vte 2.90 and tmux.
You also need to add "new-session" at the end of your .tmux.conf so that tmux attach creates a new one if none exist.

To configure it, open dconf-editor and go into /org/gnome/Germinal

To build it, go into the Germinal directory
./autogen.sh
./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc
make
sudo make install
