Germinal is a minimalist vte-based terminal emulator.
It won't evolve much since it's just a small project inspired by Sakura to fit my needs

You need glib 2.28, vte 2.30 and tmux.
You also need to add "new-session" at the end of your .tmux.conf so that tmux attach creates a new one if none exist.
